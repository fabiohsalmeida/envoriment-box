This is the following through to not get messing around and after complain about the developer:

1. Before doing any automated thing lets get our hands dirty, download and install docker and do its easy-go-through tutorial before complaining that my setup doesn't work, after that come back here.
2. NEVER execute more than once the following step;
3. Not that step but the following one, NEVER execute him more than once or your PATH are going to recive garbage and you might say "hey that program just glitched my fucking pc, that sucks";
4. You have been warned, execute once and it shall be alright;
3. After docker is ok, run the set-me-up.bat with the command ".\set-me-up.bat"

Wonderful commands:
1. Run C file: "car <fileName.c>";
2. Run Python file: "cpy <fileName.py>";
3. Run kali-linux: "kali-bash".
