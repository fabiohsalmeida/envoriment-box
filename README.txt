This is the following through to not get messing around and after complain about the developer:

1. Before doing any automated thing lets get our hands dirty, download and install docker and do its easy-go-through tutorial before complaining that my setup doesn't work, after that come back here;
2. After docker is ok, run the set-me-up.bat with the command ".\set-me-up.bat";
3. To configure kali you will have to see the notes into kali folder.

Wonderful commands:
1. Run C file: "car <fileName.c>";
2. Run Python file: "cpy <fileName.py>";
3. Run kali-linux: "kali-bash".
